Now let us understand the above program.

In the main() method, The Email ID is printed. Then the isValid() method is called to validate the Email ID. A code snippet which demonstrates this is as follows:

public static void main(String[] args) {
   String email = "uttejawasthi210@gmail.com";
   System.out.println("The E-mail ID is: " + email);
   System.out.println("Is the above E-mail ID valid? " + isValid(email));
}

In the isValid() method, Pattern.matches() method matches the regular expression for the Email ID and the given input Email ID and the result is returned. A code snippet which demonstrates this is as follows:

static boolean isValid(String email) {
   String regex = "^[\\w-_\\.+]*[\\w-_\\.]\\@([\\w]+\\.)+[\\w]+[\\w]$";
   return email.matches(regex);
}
